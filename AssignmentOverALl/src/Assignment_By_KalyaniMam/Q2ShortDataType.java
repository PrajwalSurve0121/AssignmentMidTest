//		The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive). 
//		Its minimum value is -32,768 and maximum value is 32,767. Its default value is 0.
//		The short data type can also be used to save memory just like byte data type. A short data type is 2 times smaller than an integer.
